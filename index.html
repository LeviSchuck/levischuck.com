<p>Welcome to the personal website of Levi Schuck!</p>
<p>You'll likely find some adventurous logs or rants.</p>

<h2>I build server software.</h2>
<p>
My passion is where the information flows.
I think about messages between servers, databases, and services in general in my spare and not-so-spare time.
I would like more experience with distributed systems, since that is where I spend my time researching and developing for.
</p>

<h2>I do Functional Programming.</h2>
<p>
Although one of my favorite languages is C++, lately I have been breaking my mind with Haskell.
It is rapidly becoming one of my most favorite languages, in which I feel confident with.
Detecting errors before production and release has become a big focus for me here.
</p>

<h2>I have graduated.</h2>
<p>
During my university education, I not only completed the projects for my courses, I also had several prototypal projects that I learned a great deal from.
Most of these projects have been 3D game engines or servers of various sorts.
</p>

<h2>I like spicy foreign food.</h2>
<p>
Often, I go out with an old roommate to Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian restaurants.
Fast food is often dull and leaves a bad taste.
Lately I have been practicing with chopsticks, and I think I am getting better.
Soups like ph&#7903; are quite different to what I have grown up with.
Usually, I like my foreign foods with beef when there's an option between beef, pork, and chicken.
</p>

<h2>An Australian called me a confused hipster.</h2>
<p>
	An iOS developer I know in Australia claims I am a hipster because I type in Dvorak instead of QWERTY.
	I like and code for C++ and Haskell.
	Also, I like listening to music without vocals.
</p>

<h2>I like camping and canoeing.</h2>
<p>
I like the fresh air and darkness when it comes to camping.
In the past, I really enjoyed backpacking and canoeing trips.
Although I like to fish, I haven't had much luck.
One time I got a cat fish and it was painful to bring up a foot-high bank since it was poking me with its bony fins.
I am also an eagle scout
