<p>Welcome to the personal website of Levi Schuck!</p>
<p>You'll likely find some adventurous logs or rants.</p>

<h2>I build server software.</h2>
<p>
My passion is where the information flows.
I think about messages between servers, databases, and services in general in my spare and not-so-spare time.
I would like more experience with distributed systems, since that is where I spend my time researching and developing for.
</p>

<h2>I have moved to Functional Programming.</h2>
<p>
Although one of my favorite languages is C++, lately I have been breaking my mind with Haskell.
It is rapidly becoming one of my most favorite languages, in which I feel confident with.
Unlike inheritance, aggregation and composition embodies dependable programming in my eyes.
</p>

<h2>I am a full-time student.</h2>
<p>
Even though I work on my own projects in my spare time, instead of playing games, I am a full-time student.
I anticipate graduation in April 2014 for a bachelors in computer science.
My studies are used to broaden my experiences, while my side projects push the boundaries that my education does not.
For example, as of fall semester, 2013, I am taking courses like user experience and implementing GUIs.
Yet on my own time, I am exploring concurrency with software transactional memory.
</p>

<h2>I like spicy foreign food.</h2>
<p>
Often, I go out with an old roommate to Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian restaurants.
Fast food is often dull and leaves a bad taste.
Lately I have been practicing with chopsticks, and I think I am getting better.
Soups like ph&#7903; are quite different to what I have grown up with.
Usually, I like my foreign foods with beef when there's an option between beef, pork, and chicken. 
</p>

<h2>I like camping and canoeing.</h2>
<p>
I like the fresh air and darkness when it comes to camping.
In the past, I really enjoyed backpacking and canoeing trips.
Although I like to fish, I haven't had much luck.
One time I got a cat fish and it was painful to bring up a foot-high bank since it was poking me with its bony fins.
Although I am an eagle scout, I cannot claim to still know my knots to help you tie up a hammock over a cliff.
</p>

<h2>An Australian called me a confused hipster.</h2>
<p>
	An iOS developer I know in Australia claims I am a hipster because I type in Dvorak instead of QWERTY.
	I like and code for C++ and Haskell.
	Also, I like listening to music without vocals.
	Yet, I don't dress with a scarf.
