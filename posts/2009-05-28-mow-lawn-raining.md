title: Got to mow lawn while raining
---

Well I was supposed to mow the lawn today, so I did a little before 6 PM
it was nice and cool, slightly overcast, and I was about 40% done and it started raining.

I promised I would mow it, so I continued. I got wet, had to start the mower over again like 20 times, but it worked out
