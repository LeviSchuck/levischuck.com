title: Thoughts on Deus Ex Human Revolution Directors Cut
---

DEHR Directors Cut does improve on DEHR where DEHR failed.
Namely, the DLC's and boss fights.
DLC's such as the bonus weapons were present at the beginning of the game for those that wanted to search and find them, but it was too over-powered for the first area.
The DLC weapons were correctly restocked or given another chance later in other areas, so the player did not have to waste his inventory space to keep them for possibility sake.

## Boss Fights

### Barret

Only the first boss fight was obvious and spacious enough to have a chance for me to investigate upon first doing the fight.
I was mainly distracted trying to figure out what options I had during the fight, while trying to not get destroyed by randomly thrown grenades everywhere.
After defeating the first, I investigated the scene and was semi-thrilled to see how much they put in there.. if you didn't have the pressure to constantly hide as to not die.
It still suffered from the, "I'm just trying to live, as if you give a chance to explore" problem.
I do not know if it was altered to do this, but the first boss had super-vision and practically knew where you were if you could even see a hair or ankle of his body.
I broke the first boss's walking AI temporarily by locking him in a room.
I opened the door remotely and closed it again, and then he started walking once more.

### Yelena Fedorova

The second boss fight with polygon-girl was more or less the same, but seemed easier. (Perhaps I was more experienced and planned to bring EMP grenades or mines)
After the fact, I investigated the scene and found that (if you had time) you could hack one of the key pads and open a door which could go to the top area and you could flood the chamber with poison gas.
You could also, if you disabled the later fields or used invisibility augmentations hack a computer above that would let you turn the turrets on her (when she was visible..)
The second boss fight had wonderful amounts of goodies you could get after the fact if you looked.
There were also many many EMP grenade / mines that could be used, the entire boss fight could be done entirely with what was in that room.

### Nammir

The third boss fight, with the muscle-body guy was.. a little easier, though it might just be my preparation and familiarity.
He was easily predictable, fast, but easily predictable.
Like my first time, I brought a turret with me through the elevator and dropped it out of the elevator before the fight began.
Most of the fight did not take place in a space where it could see.
After defeating using combat rifle ammo (for the first and last time in this play-through) and one or two mines, I explored the area.
Tons of weapon rewards, apparently there's a system you can hack to send off one bot, and another system for another bot to roam around and shoot him when set to enemies.
There was a vent system that you could go through and (again) use invisibility to get inside to obtain a previously-obtainable laser rifle.

### The Hyron Project

The last boss, in Panchaea, was no longer able to be killed with just a laser rifle while behind the closest pillar to the entrance door.
The shield was all-shielding now, which might as well have been an opaque wall.
There were more 'defense' systems that would activate and such.
Either you'd have to have the codes for the security panels, since too much action means little time to hack/crack.
One of the 'defense' systems was to release a bunch of random zombified crazy guards, I think twice.
Similarly, there were several rounds of bots that would go around, making life lame for trying to hack and be less violent.
Where the guards came from had tons of ammo that could be used to brute force the shield.
Or, you could do the inhumane thing and after every round of 'defense' kill one of the biological-computer girls.
The last one killed ends the 'defense' rounds.
Overall, this fight was.. more of a final-boss fight, but it was just annoyingly tedious and not deus ex style, no matter how many of the 'components' of DEHR are thrown in.

## The Missing Link

![](/images/dehr/missing-link.jpg)

The missing link DLC was effectively grafted in.
The beginning starts the exact same way, except instead of a randomized nonlethal weapon and pistol, you get all your weapons from before--but no ammo.
You effectively must use your initial pack of praxis points (after the reset) to hold those weapons, if you want to be prepared for the World-Health-Organization base next where the scientists are.
The gameplay of the missing link was the same otherwise, however they never fixed the persistent problem where they had walk-waypoint bugs and the guards would just stand and stare in the same spot forever.
I ended up knocking out one person that I had no intention to, and surprised a guard by opening a door in front of him.
The latter guard moved forward a bit to investigate, after several times, it was clear he would not go any further.
But he never moved back either.
This gave me a chance to use very short invisibility to walk around him and hide behind a box when it ran out 1.5 seconds later.
The boss was too hyper-aware (like the first one) for me to climb around and silently knock him out.
At the end, the player can wander around a partially empty base and collect their ammo, almost none of it fitting, forcing the player to pick and choose ammo vs mines, etc. from this collection.
No other content was modified for The Missing Link chapter.


## The rest of the game

Notice I never said anything about the rest of the game.
That's right, the rest of the game is the same.
I was pretty sure when they made directors cut for the Wii-U that they added more things--but apparently not.
In order to run on a lower system, likely the Wii-U, the game settings like physics were made less precise.
Bodies partially falling through the floor and thus impossible to hide..
Stuff rattling often when moving.
The physics engine, by prior (non directors cut) analysis was not all that advanced anyway.
I was disappointed.
I expected **at least one more side-quest**!
Really, I wanted at least one per major area, more back story on Jensen, something.
Nothing was there for me, no matter how in-depth I investigated.


## Conclusion

In the end, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Directors Cut, was merely made to address general complaints by the fans.
(Arguably, not actually solving them.)
Most of the extras that were present in the boss fights look tacked on like sticky notes on an instruction booklet.
Literally extruded box rooms, as if they printed out the map cross section on paper and put sticky notes on it.

While playing the Directors Cut, it felt that there was no passion evident in the chances made.
If there was a director, it wasn't a story writer, game developer, artist, or anyone else that contributed to the experience.
This was merely a move to combine the DLCs, put a band-aid on ruining the Deus-Ex experience with the bosses, and have another cash flow.
I feel the directors cut is worth the purchase, if one had not played the original.
The original, with the DLCs, felt unnatural at the beginning, with a ton of money and weapons shoved in your face.
The directors cut made the bonus-based DLCs mesh in better, but the expansion-based DLC (The Missing Link) was poorly meshed in and did not preserve the experience (by again, forcing weapons in the player's face).

![Panchaea Hole](/images/dehr/panchaea.png)

There's still a large hole to be filled.
Followers of a franchise can tell when there's little passion put into the work.
Deus Ex Invisible War failed to be a decent successor.
As far as modern games go, Deus Ex Human Revolution was an *adequate* successor, even though it succumbed to the temptations of *modern* money tactics like bonus-based DLCs.

I support future expansions in the Deus Ex universe.
Before The Missing Link was released, the developers seemed to positively anticipate work on future expansions.
I hope their anticipations are met.
