title: Desktop working once more!
---

Well, I've been on my laptop for about a month now since my desktop only lasted about a week before dying on me. I got the motherboard replaced finally through the RMA process, and now I have a working computer!
At full speed too! Big Grin

Now I can live in the 8 core(literally 4 cores with 2 threads each) world of 3.2 Ghz instead of 600 Mhz...

I don't like living in that world. It isn't 1998 anymore.
