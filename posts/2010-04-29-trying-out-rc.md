title: Trying out the Release Candidate
---

I'm currently trying to install the RC to my 4GB flash drive. At 79% now. The change on the button location is somewhat disturbing, but since I use Mac at school half the time it isn't too much of a problem.

I just hope they do not do the mac-style thing where you can only resize a window from one corner of a window.
The installer is at 85% now
I sure hope this beats karmic. That version sucked. :(

EDIT: Well, it didn't work. Lame in my opinion.
