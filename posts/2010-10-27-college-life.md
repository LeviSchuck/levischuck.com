title: College Life

First, I must say, College life is not High School life. You don't have as much free time as in High school, you will fail if you try to act like you do.
For me, even though I consider myself to be decent at math, Calculus is the hardest for me. I have over 100% in Computer Science, which to me isn't hard.
Its been a while since I last posted. Enough so that It snowed last night (though unrelated to me not posting)
I might post some more later. Its time to go.
