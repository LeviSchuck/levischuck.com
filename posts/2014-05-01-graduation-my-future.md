title: Graduation and My Future
---

On April 25th, 2014, I Levi Schuck have graduated with a computer
science degree from Brigham Young University (BYU) from the College
of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.

In June I will begin my employment at Epic Systems (medical software,
not the Unreal Engine for games).
Epic starts their employees on the first Monday of the month.
I have chosen to start in June because I would like some time at
home to relax--moving in three days after graduation would not
be in any way preferable.

## University Experience

Utah Valley, which surrounds BYU and is becoming another major
tech startup region, has physical qualities that I would prefer
to not remain in.
The mountains keep the pollution and dust stagnant, it is a desert
so it is not all that green, and my interests in distributed / large
systems fits larger-established companies that reside elsewhere.

Brigham Young University is a wonderful university with a serious
CS program.
Unlike other instances by other universities I've looked into,
BYU does not have the problem where students graduate and cannot
complete the simplest of interview questions like fizz-buzz.
The professors at BYU are competitively paid and could effectively
teach the courses.
Unlike my experience at Western Kentucky University, all the
professors had proficient English-speaking skills.
Secondly, classes were not taught by foreign grad students that
likely had difficulty being hired elsewhere.
The staff at BYU were happier to help students and did not suffer
complex pride problems that I have witnessed elsewhere.

BYU also strives to give a well-rounded education.
Some colleges, like Neumont, push these things to the side to provide
a rapid education in software development.
While at high school, the idea of never having to take these other
classes is quite appealing.
My experience is that the semi-specialized classes that fulfill the
general requirements have given me a better appreciation of the world
around me.
For example, the most memorable classes were with the
following titles:

+ History of Creativity from Pre-History to 1500 AD
	- We covered technologies, religion, government
+ Western Humanities from 1500 AD to Present
	- We covered music, art, philosophy
+ Human Geography
	- We covered cultural, technological, disease, and language
		influences and spreading based on geographical features
+ Introduction to Film
	- We covered techniques applied in film from cinematography to
		set design, script writing, and so on.

Sure, there were other courses which didn't make this list, though
I am pleased with my experience in these courses.
Without these courses, I do not think I can appreciate or think about
problems around me as in depth as I do now.
I believe I would miss certain important details without exposure
to what these courses covered.

## Future in Wisconsin

In June I will start working for Epic Systems.
As of now, I do not know which team I will join.
In a few weeks I'll talk with my recruiter about my interests and
where I may fit best.
A week later, my mentor will contact me and I will find out which
team I will start off in.

Epic currently deals with ancient VB6, current-day C#, and a
proprietary database language called cach√©.
I do not expect challenges on the language front of things.
In general, I do not expect a glamorous creative job for the first
few years.
Epic has a significant set of software for ambulatory, outpatient,
and several other contexts.

Epic Systems is growing, they are actively hiring hundreds of
developers at a time, they are building new (themed) offices on
campus rapidly, and they are also filling them with plenty of art.

Epic seems to focus on providing a developer-happiness centric
environment.
Every developer gets their own office or (due to limited buildings)
share an office with one other.
One common thing every developer needs is a mental break from
the problem they are stumped on at the moment.
By merely walking out of the personal office door, any developer
is immediately exposed to an abundance of art--which likely can
help dislodge the mindset that has lead to the developer's mental
block.

## Life in Wisconsin

Wisconsin is going to be cold though.
Yeah, being at BYU was cold too, however Wisconsin seems to have
longer ranges of cold.
I hear that they do well at cleaning the roads and such, so I
shouldn't worry about traffic related snow problems.

One quality that Wisconsin has though, which Utah lacks, is a
decent dose of lush green on the landscape--as well as the associated
clean air.
I do like some mild humidity, a green landscape, and generally clean
air.
Utah has none of this, Seattle area and parts of silicon valley
probably fit half of these descriptions, but I refuse to withstand
the financial insanity that goes on in silicon valley.

## For now, Kentucky

Until I start in June, I'll be here in Kentucky where I call my home.
However, my move up there will happen at the end of May and I need
to decide on my living circumstances soon.

Now, not all of Kentucky looks like the above, but it represents what
I feel comfortable with.
