[ZeroMQ][], is something interesting that may be worth investing time into.

I was previously looking into [Poco's offer][poco notifications] of a notification system, but this seems better since I can effectively get networking for free with it.

## What does it offer?

* The socket library that acts as a concurrency framework.
* Faster than TCP, for clustered products and supercomputing.
* Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, and multicast.
* Connect N-to-N via fanout, pubsub, pipeline, request-reply.
* Asynch I/O for scalable multicore message-passing apps.
* Large and active open source community.
* 30+ languages including C, C++, Java, .NET, Python.
* Most OSes including Linux, Windows, OS X.
* LGPL free software with full commercial support from iMatix.
