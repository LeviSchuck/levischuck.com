title: Start of a new site
---

I've opened up my new site, [levischuck.com](http://levischuck.com).
After thinking about it, I have decided that my personal adventures
should go on a site that reflects me, rather than a slowly moving
group, which primarily exists of only myself, namely [corditestudios.com](http://corditestudios.com).

After I get [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) to work on the
static site generator I am using, I will transfer over most of
my posts and the old blog will be deleted.
