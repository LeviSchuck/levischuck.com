## Objectives
Databases
:   I actively explore the architectures of new databases.
    I am familiar with the internal workings of 10/11g,
    I also study and dissect systems like MongoDB, read papers like the

    to [Datomic][].

Distributed Systems
:   I invest significant time watching and [reading the latest presentations][Speakerdeck]
    on large, networked, concurrent, distributed services. This is where
    I want to be an expert. Giving a presentation some day would also be
    exciting!
