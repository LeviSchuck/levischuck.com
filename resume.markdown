## Objectives
Databases
:   I actively explore the architectures of new databases out there.
    Although I already know some of how Oracle 10/11g work internally,
    I also study and dissect systems like MongoDB, read papers like the
    [Amazon Dynamo paper][Dynamo], and hope to write my own database similar
    to [Datomic][].

Distributed Systems
:   Continuously, I watch and [read the latest presentations][Speakerdeck]
    on large, networked, concurrent, distributed services. This is where
    I want to be an expert. Giving a presentation some day would also be
    exciting!

## Work Experience

Starting 2006 - August 2010
:   *PHP and Javascript Freelancer*
    
    Self taught developer, worked with an [associate][emile] in Holland
    for pay on various sites, ranging from custom galleries, CMS,
    to eCommerce.

    Developed in **PHP and Javascript**.

August 2010 - December 2012
:   *Student Programmer at BYU Campus Accommodations*

    Added features working with other department systems of the university.
    Updated financial system to use newer communication standard with Oracle Peoplesoft.
    Created, edited administrative report processes.
    Developed meal interface for Cannon Commons with FDA nutrition information.

    Developed in **.NET and JavaScript**.

    

January 2013 - July 2013
:   *Volunteer System Administrator for Fourth Wall LLC*
    
    I increased the uptime of a site for a moderately sized community
    with about 400-500 on-line at any moment. Reduced page execution times
    by a magnitude and prevented future disk failures by reducing
    disk thrashing. I fixed bugs in the local PHPFox installation
    and implemented caching mechanisms that increased the request load
    capacity of the server.

    Developed in **PHP**.
