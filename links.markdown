title: Link Dump

Generally the links that I will dump here will
not be largely known. An example of what is well
known is [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/).

# Databases

+ [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/) JSON oriented distributed database
+ [WhiteDB](http://whitedb.org/) A portable in-memory database with simple query support, graphing, and fast interprocess communication.
+ [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) 2nd Generation document .NET database
+ [ArangoDB](http://www.arangodb.org/) Flexible model database with an SQL-like language
+ [OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org/) Lesser known Graph database in Java

+ [Trousseau](https://github.com/oleiade/trousseau) Networked encrypted key-value database

# Server Technologies

+ [Docker](http://www.docker.io) "An open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container"
+ [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) The container operating system/layer for Docker. Made in Go.


# Languages of Interest

## Used
+ [Opa](http://opalang.org) Compile-To-Javascript functional language.
    Not really a *javascript framework* as the marketing buzzwords suggest.
    Really cool, but found to be __intensively slow__ in practice and __set off
    alarms__ for abuse at [dotcloud](https://www.dotcloud.com) for a
    [project](https://github.com/kloplop321/cactusdb)
    I made to keep track of plants. Runs on top of Node.
+ [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) Most recently
     became a fond language for me. It is a __purely functional__ language.
     This requires a huge mind shift to use effectively.
     I feel this language has really helped me think as a software developer.


## Interested but have not used
+ [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org) Redhat's recently relased language for the web.
+ [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) Mozilla's concurrent and memory-safe language.
    Still going through constant breaking changes.

# Blogs I started following

+ [Jabberwocky](http://jabberwocky.eu/) Conference speaker, does ruby and Haskell
+ [Adit](http://adit.io) This guy writes entertaining and easy to read concept articles, like software-transactional-memory
+ [Antirez weblog](http://antirez.com) Guy behind Redis
+ [Maur√≠cio Gardini](http://mauriciogardini.com/) Made a tile-like window manager

+ [The If Works](http://blog.jcoglan.com) Guy behind Faye, does Ruby and Node.js
+ [Aphyr](http://aphyr.com/) with his "Call me maybe" distributed services series

# Exciting front end projects

+ [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) a polyfill for upcoming component web standards
+ [AuraJS](http://aurajs.com/) RequireJS declarative components

# Random indivdual posts

+ [Fourier transform](http://nautil.us/blog/the-math-trick-behind-mp3s-jpegs-and-homer-simpsons-face) A bit on how encoding and lossy compression behind things can use some cool math.
+ [Feynman Technique](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/) Learn faster by teaching and simplifying the material in your own words!
