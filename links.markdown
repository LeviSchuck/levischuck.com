title: Link Dump

Generally the links that I will dump here will
not be largely known. An example of what is well
known is [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/).

# Databases

+ [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/) JSON oriented distributed database
+ [WhiteDB](http://whitedb.org/) A portable in-memory database with simple query support, graphing, and fast interprocess communication.
+ [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) 2nd Generation document .NET database
+ [ArangoDB](http://www.arangodb.org/) Flexible model database with an SQL-like language
+ [OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org/) Lesser known Graph database in Java
+ [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) An immutable database with local queries
+ [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.org) Distributed time series, events, and metrics database in Go
+ [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org) An embeddable persistant (with LevelDB) key-value store. Created by Facebook, released under the BSD license.
+ [Trousseau](https://github.com/oleiade/trousseau) Networked encrypted key-value database

# Server Technologies

+ [Docker](http://www.docker.io) "An open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container"
+ [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) The container operating system/layer for Docker. Made in Go.


# Languages of Interest

## Used
+ [Opa](http://opalang.org) Compile-To-Javascript functional language.
    Not really a *javascript framework* as the marketing buzzwords suggest.
    Really cool, but found to be __intensively slow__ in practice and __set off
    alarms__ for abuse at [dotcloud](https://www.dotcloud.com) for a
    [project](https://github.com/kloplop321/cactusdb)
    I made to keep track of plants. Runs on top of Node.
+ [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) Most recently
     became a fond language for me. It is a __purely functional__ language.
     This requires a huge mind shift to use effectively.
     I feel this language has really helped me think as a software developer.
+ [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) Compiles Clojure to JavaScript.
     It is really cool since I can do Go-like CSP, and with Facebook's react, make
     fast, dependable UIs that do not leak. Unfortunately, the JS that is emitted is
     quite fat.

## Interested but have not used
+ [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org) Redhat's recently relased language for the web.
+ [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) Mozilla's concurrent and memory-safe language.
    Still going through constant breaking changes.
